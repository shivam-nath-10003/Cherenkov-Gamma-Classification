# CherenkovGammaClassification

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for the classification of high-energy gamma and hadron events detected by a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. The dataset used in this project consists of pulses left by incoming Cherenkov photons on photomultiplier tubes, forming patterns known as shower images. These images enable the discrimination of signals caused by primary gamma rays from background images generated by cosmic rays.

## Features:

- **Data preprocessing:** Standardization and oversampling techniques are applied to address class imbalance.
- **Model training:** Various classification algorithms including k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks are implemented and evaluated.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** A grid search approach is employed to optimize neural network hyperparameters for improved performance.
- **Evaluation:** Classification reports are generated to assess the accuracy and other metrics of each model.
