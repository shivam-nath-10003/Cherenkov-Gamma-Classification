# CherenkovGammaClassification

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for the classification of high-energy gamma and hadron events detected by a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. The dataset used in this project consists of pulses left by incoming Cherenkov photons on photomultiplier tubes, forming patterns known as shower images. These images enable the discrimination of signals caused by primary gamma rays from background images generated by cosmic rays.

## Features:

- **Data preprocessing:** Standardization and oversampling techniques are applied to address class imbalance.
- **Model training:** Various classification algorithms including k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks are implemented and evaluated.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** A grid search approach is employed to optimize neural network hyperparameters for improved performance.
- **Evaluation:** Classification reports are generated to assess the accuracy and other metrics of each model.

## Dataset:

## Usage:

Researchers and practitioners interested in gamma-ray astronomy, machine learning, and classification tasks can utilize this repository as a reference for building similar pipelines or benchmarking their algorithms against established models.

## Contributions:

Contributions and feedback from the community are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests for improvements or suggest enhancements to the existing codebase.

## Streamlit App:

A new file named `gamma_hadron_streamlit.py` has been added to create an interactive web application using Streamlit. This app allows users to visualize histograms of dataset features, scale the dataset with optional oversampling, and train machine learning models with various algorithms. Run the app by executing `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` in your terminal.
